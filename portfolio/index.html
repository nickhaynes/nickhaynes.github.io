        <p class="portfolioSampleText">From 2008-2009 and 2011-2016, I served as the jack of all trades for Missouri State Representative Mark Parkinson of St. Charles.  Almost every legislator in the Missouri House of Representatives (unless they are leadership) is only allowed one staff member to handle everything they face.  Constituent relations.  Legislative research.  Communications.  Scheduling and office management.  You wear many hats as a staffer.  In this role, one of the roles I took on was web developer.  I built his official website entirely from scratch, incorporating several features that went well above and beyond what is required of Missouri legislators.  From putting office expenses out in the open to using technology to streamline several processes such as courtesy resolutions, and incorporating social media where possible, our office led the way in embracing new and innovative ways to use technology to reach the people Representative Parkinson was elected to serve.<br><br>The code was lost on this, so I am in the process of rebuilding it using web archive services to match the original code.</p>
