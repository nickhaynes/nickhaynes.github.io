RIVER RUNNER--The New Frogger
===============================

It's a beautiful day for a swim--if only it weren't for all these bugs!  Bugs keep any person from enjoying a good swim in the river, so how do you get the chance for a dip?  Easy--RUN!

## How to Play the Game

Use your keypad.  Up is up, down is down, left...you get the idea.
AVOID THE BUG(S)!  If you hit a bug, you get sent home, and have to recover from the bugbites and try again.
Don't leave the screen.  You can go side to side--that's just smart strategy--but you can't leave the field.  Nobody wins by running away--set your goal, and run through the field, not to another field.

## How Do I Win?

Open the file--in this case, the index HTML file.  Count the bugs.  Time the bugs.  Run.  Get to the river.  Then swim in the river.  Not too long, though--then it's off to find another river to swim in!
