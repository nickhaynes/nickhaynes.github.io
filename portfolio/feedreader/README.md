# Feed Reader Testing Project

This is the final project for Area 3 of the front-end nanodegree program through Udacity.  In it, you have a simple RSS feed reader that has been provided for you.  The goal isn't building the feed reader; it is building the testing suites (through the Jasmine framework) that will ensure the feed reader is functioning as intended.

## Operation

Open the index.html file.  The test is built in and will automatically run.  If the results are green, all tests pass.  If there is red, there is 1 or more failure(s).
